# Project Details

The Jungle Cook is a great tool for people to store custom recipes and/or look for other user created food recipes. Initially, a user will sign up/create an account. Once that process is done, a user is signed-in automatically. They can now log out and log back in whenever desired. Anyone can view the "browse" tab (signed-in users and signed-out users) where they will be greeted upon a variety of user created recipes. Once a user logs in, they will be able to see all of their created recipes under the "your recipes" tab. Click on the "view" button to get more in-depth instructions on how to make your food item. Under the same "your recipes" tab, you can also delete your recipes and/or edit them. A signed-in user can create a new recipe on the "create recipe" tab. Once a user is finished accessing The Jungle Cook, they can sign out with the yellow button in the top right corner.
